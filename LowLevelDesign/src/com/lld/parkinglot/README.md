# Design a parking lot system

1. A parking lot can have multiple buildings. 
2. Each building has multiple levels.
3. Each level has multiple slots. From bike to truck, there would be slots of different 
sizes and a large enough vehicle can be accommodated with multiple slots if required.
4. There could be multiple entry and exit points per building.
5. While entering the parking lot, a ticket should be issued with parking slots allocated
for the concerned vehicle. It can be issues by a human being or in automated manner.
6. While exiting / checking out, payment should be done accordingly and a payment receipt
should be generated.
